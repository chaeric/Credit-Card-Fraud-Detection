# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Used kaggle credit card fraud detection dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)<br />
Project Overview

This project focuses on credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques to address the challenges of highly imbalanced transaction data. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was explored and visualized to uncover key patterns and anomalies in fraudulent versus legitimate transactions.

Methodology

To mitigate the imbalance problem, both undersampling and SMOTE oversampling strategies were applied and benchmarked against one another. The models were further optimized by tuning the precisionâ€“recall threshold, which is especially important for fraud detection tasks where minimizing false negatives and controlling false positives directly impacts business costs.

Results

The optimized model achieved an F1 score of 90%, demonstrating strong predictive performance in identifying fraudulent activity. Beyond technical metrics, the project also developed a business case application, illustrating how organizations can integrate such a model into their operations to reduce financial losses in critical areas by minimizing both missed fraud cases and unnecessary fraud alerts.
